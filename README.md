## 💡 Why Use This API?

Modern apps need security, observability, and scalability baked in from day one — this API gives you:

- **Fast setup** for production-ready auth flows
- **Rate limiting out of the box** for abuse prevention
- **Redis integration** for real-time features and token management

---

## 🧠 Example Use Case

You're building a SaaS app in **React**. Instead of building login, auth, and rate-limiting yourself, just call this API:

- `/register`: Sign up user and send verification OTP  
- `/login`: Authenticate + return JWT  
- `/verify-email`: Submit OTP to activate account  
- `/refresh-token`: Rotate tokens securely  
- `/admin`: Protected routes for admin actions  
- All protected routes use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
